# README

This app is responsible for posting data the user sends by graphql through RabbitMQ, and retrieving the data from the REST API on the app2 and returning it in GraphQL queries.

There's a playground available at `localhost:3001/graphiql` to test the queries and mutations, and examples on the main readme.
